inferiorly. A Vesseloop was placed around the nerve itself. At
this location in the posterior thigh, the nerve had already
started to split into the peroneal and tibial components. The
primary tumor was located on the peroneal component of the sciatic
nerve. The nerve was stimulated at its periphery and found a
region which did not stimulate. The capsule in this location was
then opened, and the tumor was removed and dissected free from the
residual nerve. There were some small areas of tumor superior and
inferior which were not contiguous with this lesion. The tumor
was approximately 4 x 2 cm.

Next, hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery and Floseal.
The wound was then copiously irrigated. RA piece of Gelfilm was
placed over the nerve to prevent adhesions in case further surgery
was needed in this location. The wound was then closed in a
layered fashion with interrupted Vicryl stitches and a
subcuticular gut suture overlaid with Dermabond and Steri-Strips.
At the end of the OR course, all needle, sponge, and instrument
counts were correct.

I, the attending neurosurgeon, , was
present for all critical portions of the OR course and was
immediately available for the entire OR course. The patient was
at her neurological baseline by neuromonitoring at the end of the
course.
