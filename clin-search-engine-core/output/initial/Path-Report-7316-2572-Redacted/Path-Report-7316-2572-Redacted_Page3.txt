GROSS DESCRIPTION

B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section in a container labeled
with the patient's name, medical record number and designated "brain
tumor‚Äù. It consists of a piece of pink-tan tissue measuring 2 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative tissue is submitted for frozen evaluation and
squash preps are performed. The frozen tissue is kept frozen and sent to
cytogenetics for BRAF and genome wide array. The remainder of the specimen
is submitted in cassette A.

 

 

B. The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and designated "brain tumor". It
consists of a small fragment of pink-tan tissue measuring 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted for research according to the
CBTTC protocol. No cassettes are submitted.

 

C. The specimen is received in formalin in a container labeled with the REN
patient's name, medical record number and designated "brain tumor".

It consists of multiple irregular fragments of gelatinous red-tan tissue

measuring 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in

cassette C. [RE

 

 

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

Low grade glioma consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma.

MICRCSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Microscopic examination was performed on H&E stained sections and additional

sections stained with immunoperoxidase methods for Ki-67 and GFAP.

Microscopic sections demonstrate an astrocytic tumor predominantly composed
of compact bipolar cells with Rosenthal fibers; a loose component is present
as well with microcysts. There are no mitoses or necrosis. The
proliferative activity is very low. The tumor cells are reactive for GFAP.
