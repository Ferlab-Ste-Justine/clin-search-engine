ADDENDUM

Addendum #1
This addendum is issued to report the result of genetic test.
The quality for DNA isolated from this tumor specimen was poor. This

sub-optil DNA sample will not be submitted for genome wide SNP array study.
Submitting another tumor sample for appropriate tests is recommended.

 

   

Sanger sequencing analysis was performed on the DNA extracted from this tumor
sample. There was no evidence for V60OE mutation in the exon 15 of the BRAF
gene. However, the overall sequencing quality wes poor so the mutations at
the remaining coding regions of this gene and low mosaic changes cannot be
ruled out.

Molecular profiling with newly launched NGS panel for solid tumor is highly
recommended to help with differential diagnosis, risk stratification and
treatment selection.
