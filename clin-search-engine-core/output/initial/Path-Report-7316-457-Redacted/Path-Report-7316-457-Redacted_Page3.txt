FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

A. LOW GRADE TUMOR; DEFERRED TO PERMANENT.
B. MYXOID NEOPLASM, POSSIBLE CHORDOMA.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Microscopic examination was performed on H&E stained sections and additional
sections (from blocks Bl, B2 and C) stained with immunoperoxidase methods for
S$-100, EMA, and pancytokeratin (CK).

Microscopic sections demonstrate a tumor composed of lobules separated by
dense collagen.

The neoplastic cells are epithelial in appearance and strung out in rows and
cords within a mucoid matrix. The cytologic appearance varies from
nonvacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm, through one containing a single
vacuoles or multiple vacuoles with bubbly cytoplasm (physaliphorous cells).
The cells are positive for EMA, cytokeratin and S-100. There are no mitoses.
