FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Brain, “Cerebellar tumor superior”, resection: Pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade |; see comment.
B. Brain, “tumor cyst wall”, resection: Scattered tumor cells within a gliotic cyst wall.

C. Brain, “tumor cyst wall anterior boundary”, resection: Scattered tumor cells within a gliotic cyst
wall.

D. Brain, crebellar tumor, resection: Pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade I; see comment.

E. Brain, cerebellar tumor, resection: Pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade I; see comment.

COMMENT:

Sections show fragments of a moderately cellular and mostly solid-appearing glial neoplasm, exhibiting a biphasic
architecture. Neoplastic cells are mostly arranged in loose fascicles with microcysts, alternating with smaller compact
areas with dense fibrillarity. The neoplastic cells show piloid cytology with thin elongate processes, along with round to
oval nuclei with coarsely granular chromatin. Multinucleated cells with radially arranged nuclei resembling a “pennies on a
plate” pattern are frequent. Mitotic figures are inconspicuous. Abundant Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies
are noted in the background. There is no evidence of microvascular proliferation or tumor cell necrosis in this material.
The morphologic features are consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade I.
