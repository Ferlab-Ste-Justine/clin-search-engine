Final Diagnosis:

7wk old male, right frontal seizure focus: Cortical Dysplasia type IIB

Microscopy:

All the tissue examined is abnormal. There is evidence of fusion of the sulci with buried molecular
layer, and lamination is completely obliterated as the cortical ribbon is replaced by large dysplastic
neurons and many balloon cells. The latter are also particularly prominent in the subpial and
molecular areas and in the white matter which is markedly attenuated. Calcifications abound.
