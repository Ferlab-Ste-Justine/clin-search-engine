B,D) H&E stained sections contain cortical gray and white matter with possible mild gliosis matter. No
neoplastic cells are appreciated.

E) H&E stained sections contain cortical tissue including hippocampus. No frank dysplasia, significant
gliosis, neuronal dropout or neoplasm is appreciated.

F) H&E stained slides contain fragmenis of a hyperceliular neoplasm, with the morphology similar to
that sezn in parts A and C. Numerous fragments of uninvolved brain parenchyma are appreciated
which include gray matter with readily identifiable neurons and white matter tracts. No necrosis or
microvascular proliferation is appreciated.

Diagnosis
A,C,F) BRAIN, TUMOR AND CUSA CONTENTS, RESECTION:
HIGH GRADE NEOPLASM (SEE COMMENT)
B,D) BRAIN, LATERAL TEMPORAL LOBE AND INFERIOR BORDER, RESECTION:
- CORTICAL TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM
E) BRAIN, HIPPOCAMPUS, RESECTION:
- HIPPOCAMPUS, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM
