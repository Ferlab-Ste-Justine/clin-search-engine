gentle suction. After opening the dura into the temporal horn,
the choroid plexus was seen. The tumor was seen inside the
ventricular system. Multiple biopsies were sent. Sonopet was
used to remove tumor in the ventricular system. We then paid
attention to the uncus and that was carefully subgaleally
dissected. Third nerve was seen and given the extent of the
tumor, were not overly aggressive once we began removing uncus to
provide plenty of room for radiation. Once ventricular tumor was
out and most of the tumor along the uncus going back to the
hippocampus was out, meticulous hemostasis was achieved. The dura
was then closed with 4-0 Nurolon and covered with DuraGen. Neuro
monitoring was stable throughout the case except for a short while
decreased in the right lower extremity, which returned to baseline
by the end of the procedure. Bone was replaced with titanium
plates and screws, and the incision closed in layers. The skin
edge reapproximated with staples. The patient was extubated and
taken to the PICU.
