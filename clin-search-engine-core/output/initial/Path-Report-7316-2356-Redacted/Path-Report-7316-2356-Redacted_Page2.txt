MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Abundant tissue is available for study. All sections have been stained
with HEE.

The tumor is composed of fields of astrocytes with mature nuclei. There
is a variable amount of perikaryal substance and some cells have
processes. In general the cells are closely arranged but in a few
regions there is a looser pattern of growth. Mitotic figures are not
seen and there is no well-established necrosis. A prominent vascular
component is characterized by many vessels with swollen endothelial
cells, glomeruloids and some wicker-works. There are scattered calcium
deposits.

Results of immunoperoxidase studies are as follows:

GFAP: widespread 4+ expression

Factor 8: widespread 4+ expression in vascular component

NFP: no expression

Kig7: most prominent in vasculature; about 1-2% in the tumor

FINAL DIAGNOSIS

ASTROCYTOMA, FIBRILLARY TYPE WITH PROMINENT NEOVASCULARIZATION, Ih.

COMMENT: Whereas this tumor displays no significant cytologic anaplasia the

presence of this prominently proliferative vascular component is a
matter of considerable concern.
